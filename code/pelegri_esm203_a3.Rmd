### Analysis 


1. Set up a simple mass balance model of groundwater driven by inputs and outputs.


2. Specify the initial inputs and outputs for 2000. This requires determining the inputs and losses of groundwater in Figure 2.

Some Hints: 

- The total amount of groundwater use (outputs) is provided in the Groundwater label. It was 18.2 in the year 2000 according to Figure 2, and will be 27 in the year 2050 under BAU 5 assumptions, according to Figure 4.
- The net change in groundwater in 2000 is the Chg in groundwater storage. It was -5.4 according to Figure 2, meaning that groundwater levels declined in 2000. the 2050 estimate for net change in groundwater is -16.7, according to Figure 4.
- The net change in groundwater is equal to the inputs minus the outputs. Because Figures 2 and 4 provide us with the net change in groundwater and the outputs (withdrawals), you can solve for inputs. In 2000, these inputs were 18.2 - 5.4 = 12.8 (cf.Figure 2). In 2050, the estimated input is 27 - 16.7 = 10.3

```{r fig2}

out00 = 18.2
chng00 = -5.4
in00 =  chng00 + out00
in00

```

3. Determine the conditions at the end of the simulation (2050). This requires determining the inputs and outputs of groundwater in Figure 4.

```{r fig4}

out50 = 27
chng50 = -16.7
in50 = chng50 + out50
in50

```

4. Fit a linear trend in the input and output terms between the year 2000 and 2050 in order to determine the transient changes in recharge and withdrawals over this 50-year period.

```{r linear}
# fit linear trend lines between the years 2000-2050
year <- c(2000, 2050)

# trend line for inputs
in_trend <- c(in00, in50)
in_lm <- lm(in_trend ~ year)
in_lm

# trend line for outputs
out_trend <- c(out00, out50)
out_lm <- lm(out_trend ~ year)
out_lm

# trend line for change
chnge_trend <- in_trend - out_trend
chnge_lm <- lm(chnge_trend ~ year)
```

```{r}
# create a data frame with all the years from 2000-2050
years <- seq(from=2000, to=2050, by=1)
massbal <- as.data.frame(years)

# use the equation from lm to fill in columns for ins and outs
massbal$ins = -0.05*massbal$years + 112.8
massbal$outs = 0.176*massbal$years - 333.8

head(massbal)
```


```{r}
# plot the ins and outs over the years - what will happen to storage based on these trends?
ggplot(massbal) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=years, y=ins, col='Input')) +
  geom_line(aes(x=years, y=outs, col='Output')) +
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab(TeX("Groundwater flux ($10^9$ $m^3$)")) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

# can do mass balance for each year to see the changes 
massbal$chnge = massbal$ins - massbal$out
ggplot(massbal) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=years, y=chnge)) +
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab(TeX("Change in groundwater ($10^9$ $m^3$)"))

# # can also get the linear model of the change each year - fix this
massbal$chnge_lm <- chnge_lm
```


5. Calculate the changes in groundwater resources from 2000-2050 for at least three scenarios based on varying initial conditions of groundwater availability: The expected amount of groundwater (from section 2, above) as well as for upper and lower estimates provided in section 2.

- From Curmi et al., Figure 7, you can assume that the expected value of groundwater resources in 2000 was
*350x10^9 m3*. Let's further assume that uncertainty regarding this value follows a normal distribution around that mean value, with a standard deviation of 115x109 m3. 
- Based on a normal distribution with this mean and standard deviation, there is a 90% chance that the actual
amount of groundwater in CA is somewhere between the approximate lower limit of *190x10^9 m3*
and an approximate upper limit of *550x10^9 m3*.

```{r scenarios}
# all of the flows were also 10^9, so there is no need for unit conversions

# integrate over the water lost starting in 2000
water_lost <- function(year){
  int <- integrate(function(x){-0.226*x + 446.6}, lower = 2000, upper = year) #this function comes from the linear model of change over year
  return(int$value)
}
massbal$w_lost <- sapply(massbal$years, water_lost)

# create columns for the average, lower bounds, and upper bounds
massbal$gw_storage = massbal$w_lost + 350
massbal$gw_low = massbal$w_lost + 190
massbal$gw_upp = massbal$w_lost + 550

head(massbal)

```

### Create plots

```{r plot}
# use ggplot here to create a beautiful plot to include

# example plot which we don't need to show - not the nicest
ggplot(massbal) + 
  geom_rect(aes(ymin=-Inf, ymax=0, xmin=2000, xmax=2050), alpha = 0.02, fill='red') +
  geom_line(aes(x=__, y=__, col='Average')) +
  geom_line(aes(x=__, y=__, col='Bounds'), linetype='dashed') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=__, y=__, col='Bounds'), linetype='dashed') +
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab(TeX("Groundwater stoarge ($10^9$ $m^3$)")) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  ggtitle("Projected groundwater under business as usual with 90% confidence interval")
  

```

### All that is left is for the presentation! 

Your findings should be presented in the form of a brief 1-2 page technical brief. This document should summarize your approach, present your analysis in 1 or 2 clear and compelling figures, and provide a set of key findings that could be incorporated into a broader policy-focused presentation to stakeholders. Any figures should contain information regarding uncertainty, and should be able to "stand alone” from the work based on only the title, labels, figure text, and a brief caption. Your brief should also highlight any key assumptions, data sources, and provide recommendations on next steps to improve or refine your assessment. Your brief should be written for a broad audience, but you should make sure to communicate in a scientific/ professional manner.
